### Search and Filter Invoices

To streamline the management of invoices, Sellista provides search and filter functionalities:

1. **Search:** Use the search bar at the top of the invoices page to quickly find a specific invoice by entering keywords related to the invoice number, order ID, or customer name.
2. **Filter:** Use the filter options to narrow down the invoice list based on specific criteria, such as date range, payment status, or due date.

### Archiving Invoices

To keep your invoice list organized, you can archive invoices that are no longer active or needed in the main view. To view archived invoices, check the "Show archive" option at the top right of the invoices page.
