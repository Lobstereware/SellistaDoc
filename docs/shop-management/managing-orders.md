### Adding Customer Details

Customers can be added to an order manually or automatically:

1. **Manual Addition:** In the **Customer details** section of the new order modal, search for an existing customer using the search bar. If the customer does not exist, click **+ New Customer** to add a new customer. Fill in the customer's information, including first name, last name, company (optional), email, phone number, and address details. Click "Save" to add the customer.
2. **Automatic Creation:** When a customer makes a purchase from your website or any connected sales channel, their information is automatically captured, and a customer profile is created. The order is then automatically added to the **Order List** in Sellista.

### Automatic Invoice Creation

When an order is created and saved in Sellista, a new invoice is automatically generated and added to the "Invoices" section. This ensures that each order has a corresponding invoice for record-keeping and customer reference. (We will cover the **Invoices** section in detail later.)


> By following these steps, you can efficiently manage orders in Sellista, ensuring that all customer and product information is accurately recorded and that any applicable discounts, shipping costs, and statuses are included. This streamlined order management process helps improve the efficiency of your e-commerce operations, leading to better customer satisfaction and business growth. Additionally, the automatic creation of orders and customer profiles from your sales channels further simplifies order management and ensures all purchases are tracked seamlessly.
